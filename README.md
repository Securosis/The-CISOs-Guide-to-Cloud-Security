#What CISOs Need to Know about Cloud Computing

##Overview

This paper highlights the critical differences between cloud computing and traditional infrastructure, providing CISOs and other security professionals the key knowledge to make cloud security decisions. It also details specific areas for adapting security controls, and recommendations for what to do.

The report is in the file `CISO_Cloud.md`.

##Open Research Process

Securosis has long followed our [Totally Transparent Research process](https://securosis.com/about/totally-transparent-research), where we post all draft research on our blog for public comment and review. I am experimenting with using GitHub as a more interactive way of opening up this process, so people can directly propose and submit changes. This will also expose more of our editing process.

This paper is being posted as a complete first draft, but most papers will be posted in pieces as we post them on the blog. We will collect feedback from both systems, especially because we are still learning how to use GitHub to write and host research.

Please post suggestions here, or feel free to email me at rmogull@securosis.com.
