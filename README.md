##Open Research Process

Securosis has long followed our [Totally Transparent Research process](https://securosis.com/about/totally-transparent-research), where we post all draft research on our blog for public comment and review. I am experimenting with using GitHub as a more interactive way of opening up this process, so people can directly propose and submit changes. This will also expose more of our editing process.

This paper is being posted as a complete first draft, but most papers will be posted in pieces as we post them on the blog. We will collect feedback from both systems, especially because we are still learning how to use GitHub to write and host research.

We posted a [GitHub tutorial on our site](https://securosis.com/blog/how-to-edit-our-research-on-github) in case you're new to the platform.

Please post suggestions here, or feel free to email me at rmogull@securosis.com.
